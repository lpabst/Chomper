Game Idea, vanilla JS host on heroku

TODO

Eating all of the numbers on a level takes you to the next level
Each level has a different map layout, higher point numbers, and more bad guys
Every now and then I'll have a money dollar sign pop up on the screen that you can collect
The highest levels should be really hard or near impossible to beat.
Completing the highest level can take you back to level 1, but your points/powerups remain
Bad guys & the user should have a speed and a strength displayed
	- Whoever has higher strength wins (you vs them)
Different kinds of bad guys do different things, move in different ways?
	- one could go through walls but move slow, another could be super fast but only go in circles, etc
Warp locations that only the player can use?

You can pause the game and visit the store, where you can buy powerups using $$$
While in the store, you slowly lose points, don't spend too long there
Each item must be purchased using money $$$ 
We'll have a button to trade points for $$$, but the house takes a cut! trade wisely
powerups can increase the amount of points you see on the screen
powerups can grant you temporary or permanent strength to kill bad guys
powerups can grant you extra lives

There will be a HUD that shows your lives, points, level you're on, etc...

I don't want a backend or security, so high scores will be kept in the localStorage




DONE

There is a map with obstacles that you live on
you're a guy that runs around and eats numbers on the map. 
The numbers are points and have different colors
There are computer generated bots that can kill you
