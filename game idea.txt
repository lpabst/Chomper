Gameplay
Every now and then I'll have a money dollar sign pop up on the screen that you can collect
Warp locations that only the player can use?

DONE

gameplay
There is a map with obstacles that you live on
you're a guy that runs around and eats numbers on the map. 
The numbers are points and have different colors
There are computer generated bots that can kill you
Different kinds of bad guys do different things, move in different ways?
	- one could go through walls but move slow, another could be super fast but only go in circles, etc
There will be a HUD that shows your lives, points, level you're on, etc...
Better bad guy movement logic to not get stuck if you're on the other side of a walls
Bad guys & the user should have a speed and a strength displayed
	- Whoever has higher strength wins (you vs them)
when player is blinking, bad guys stop moving
Eating all of the numbers on a level takes you to the next level
Each level has a different map layout, higher point numbers, and more bad guys
Completing the highest level can take you back to level 1, but your points/powerups remain
I don't want a backend or security, so high scores will be kept in the localStorage
The highest levels should be really hard or near impossible to beat. (resetting to lvl 1 makes the enemies better)

shop
You can pause the game and visit the store, where you can buy powerups using $$$
Each item must be purchased using money $$$ 
powerups can increase the amount of points you see on the screen
powerups can grant you temporary or permanent strength to kill bad guys
powerups can grant you extra lives
